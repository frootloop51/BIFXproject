Workflow

We're a little bit uncertain about our workflow. It's terrifyingly long
and we aren't quite sure where to start, but here is the link so we
don't forget.
https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/methylationArrayAnalysis/inst/doc/methylationArrayAnalysis.html.

{r} BiocManager::install("methylationArrayAnalysis")

{r} dataDirectory \<- system.file("extdata", package =
"methylationArrayAnalysis") \# list the files list.files(dataDirectory,
recursive = TRUE)

Running Code

When you click the Render button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

{r} 1 + 1

You can add options to executable code like this

{r} #\| echo: false 2 \* 2

The echo: false option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).
